This is a small C++ program that does the math to determine the RF production and to find the max flow rate of an Industrial Turbine from Mekanism. The formulas are from the official [mekanism wiki](https://wiki.aidancbrady.com/wiki/Industrial_Turbine).

I don't think it's determining the Disperser flow rate correctly but I am not sure how to get the proper number for turbine volume if that is the issue.
